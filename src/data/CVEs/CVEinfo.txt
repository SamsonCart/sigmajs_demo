CVEs are of the following format:

[
    {
        NVD_score
        Attack_vector (Network [N], Adjacent [A], Local [L], Physical [P])
        Attack Complexity: High [H], Low [L]
        Privileges Required: High [H], Low [L], None [N]
        User Interaction: (None [N], Required [R])

        I am considering adding:
        Scope: Changed [C], Unchanged [U]
        Confidentiality: High [H], Low [L], None [N]
        Integrity: High [H], Low [L], None [N]
        Availability: High [H], Low [L], None [N]
    }
]
